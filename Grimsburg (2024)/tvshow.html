			Marvin Flute may be the greatest detective ever to catch a cannibal clown or correctly identify a mid-century modern armoire. But there&rsquo;s one mystery he still can&rsquo;t crack &mdash; his family. Now that he's back in Grimsburg, a town where everyone has a secret or three, Flute will follow every lead he&rsquo;s got to redeem himself with the ex-wife he never stopped loving, even if it means hanging out with the son he never bothered to get to know.
