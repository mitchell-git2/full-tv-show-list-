			Everett and Eric Saunders are two brothers reluctantly following in their father&rsquo;s footsteps in commercial office moving. Everett, the owner of Shazam Moving, is fighting to keep his business afloat against stiff competition. Alongside his brother Eric, and a quirky crew of co-workers, Everett struggles to keep it together to land a big enough contract to be bought out by Zenithon Logistics, a moving industry giant. The Saunders brothers battle each other, their family and their crew as they face the unforgiving nature of the Toronto office moving game to make a last-ditch attempt to cash out and leave moving behind for good.
